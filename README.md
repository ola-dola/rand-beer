# ðŸ“– &nbsp; Instructions

**Objective:** The purpose of this test is to assess your skills as a React developer in creating
a user interface, implementing data fetching, and adding filtering functionality. Your task is to
retrieve data from a given API and create a page that displays a list of beer cards using
React components. Additionally, you need to include a search bar component to filter the
beer list by name.

**Requirements:** Data Source: Fetch data from the API provided at
[punkAPI](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2). For each beer, the required JSON attributes are
name, tagline, and image_url.

**React Page:** Develop a React page that shows a list of beer cards. Each beer card should
display the beer&#39;s name, tagline, and image. Use the retrieved data to populate the beer
cards dynamically.

**Search Bar Component:** Implement a search bar component on the React page. Allow
users to enter a search query and filter the beer list based on the beer&#39;s name. Update the
beer cards dynamically to reflect the search results.

**Guidelines:** Utilize appropriate React components and layouts to create an aesthetically
pleasing and user-friendly interface. Implement data fetching from the provided API using
suitable networking techniques. Ensure proper error handling and graceful handling of
network failures or missing data. Write clean and maintainable code following React coding

**Conventions and best practices.** Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools that you
consider necessary to complete the task efficiently.
